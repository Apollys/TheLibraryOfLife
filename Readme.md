# The Library of Life: Literary Gems

A selection of the most insightful books I've read, covering a wide variety of topics.

My intention with this list is twofold:

1. To provide a list of recommendations for extremely high-quality books containing valuable information that I think are very likely to benefit anyone who reads them.
2. To provide particularly insightful or interesting passages from each book that may spark your interest, so that you can efficiently decide and prioritize which books would be most valuable for you to read.

#### Rough-Cut Gems

Not quite absolutely top-tier books, but still books that I felt were definitely worth reading.

These books have very high quality insights and ideas, but end up in this category because either: I felt the author spent too much time sidetracked from the core value of the book, or I felt the book was very *interesting* but not hugely *impactful* to how I actually live my life or see the world.
