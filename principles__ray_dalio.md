I think I'll just let the writing speak for itself for this one.

### Sparks

> In retrospect my [metaphorical] crash was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it gave me the humility I needed to balance my aggressiveness. I learned a great fear of being wrong that shifted my mind-set from thinking "I'm right" to asking myself "How do I know I'm right?"

> I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which teh game gets harder and the stakes become ever greater.

> 1. Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.
>
> 2. Don't worry about looking good — worry instead about achieving your goals.
>
> 3. Don't overweight first-order [immediate] consequences relative to second- and third-order [long-term] ones.
>
> 4. Don't let pain stand in the way of progress.
>
> 5. Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.
>
> [162]

<br/>

> 1. Have clear goals.
>
> 2. Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.
>
> 3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. [Don't just band-aid symptoms; fix root causes.]
>
> 4. Design plans that will get you around them.
>
> 5. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.
>
> [169]

<br/>

> Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have everything you want.
>
> [172]

<br/>

> View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you.
>
> [174]

<br/>

> Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in the way of their success; find yours and deal with it.
>
> [179]

<br/>

> Remember that you're looking for the best answer, not simply the best answer that you can come up with yourself.
>
> [189]

<br/>

> Closed-minded people focus much more on being understood than on understanding others.
>
> Open-minded people always feel compelled to see things through others' eyes.
>
> [197]

<br/>

> Remind yourself that it's never harmful to at least hear an opposing point of view.
>
> [236]

<br/>

> Remember the 80/20 rule and know what the key 20 percent is.
>
> The 80/20 Rule states that you get 80 percent of the value out of something from 20 percent of the information or effort. Understanding this rule saves you from getting bogged down in unnecessary detail.
>
> [246]

<br/>

> "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." [Carl Jung]
>
> It's even more important that decision making be evidence-based and logical when groups of people are working together. If it's not, the process will inevitably be dominated by the most powerful rather than the most insightful participants, which is not only unfair but suboptimal.
>
> [251]

<br/>

> The best choices are the ones that have more pros than cons, not those that don't have any cons at all.
>
> [253]

<br/>

> Never say anything about someone that you wouldn't say to them directly and don't try people without accusing them to their faces.
>
> [327]

<br/>

> Create a culture in which it is okay to make mistakes and unacceptable not to learn from them.
>
> Everyone makes mistakes. The main difference is that successful people learn from them and unsuccessful people don't.
>
> [348]

<br/>

> Every mistake that you make and learn from will save you from thousands fo similar mistakes in the future.
>
> [352]

<br/>

> Fast talking can be especially effective when it's used against people worried about appearing stupid. Don't be one of those people [one who worries about appearing stupid]. If you're feeling pressured, say something like "Sorry for being stupid, but I'm going to need to slow you down so I can make sense of what you're saying." Then ask your questions. All of them.
>
> [367]

<br/>

> Find the most believable people possible who disagree with you and try to understand their reasoning.
>
> [375]

<br/>

> Don't pay as much attention to people's conclusions as to the reasoning that led them to their conclusions.
>
> [376]

<br/>

> Evaluate accurately, not kindly.
>
> In the end, accuracy and kindness are the same thing. What might seem kind but isn't accurate is harmful to the person and often to others as well.
>
> [426]

<br/>

> Know that most everyone thinks that what they did, and what they are doing, is much more important than it really is.
>
> [427]

<br/>

> Don't treat everyone the same — treat them appropriately.
>
> If you were a tailor you wouldn't give all of your customers the same size suit.
>
> [463]

<br/>

> Problems are like coal thrown into a locomotive engine because burning them up — inventing and implementing solutions for them — propels us forward. Every problem you find is an opportunity to improve your machine.
>
> [473]

<br/>

> People have a strong tendency to slowly get used to unacceptable things that would shock them if they saw them with fresh eyes.
>
> [476]

<br/>

> Don't be afraid to fix the difficult things.
>
> [480]

<br/>

> Remember that a good machine takes into account the fact that people are imperfect. Design in such a way that you produce good results even when people make mistakes.
>
> [501]
