# How to Change Your Mind

Psychedelics aren't just for people who want to transform the world into a kaleidoscopic panorama — they can actually teach us a lot about how our minds work, and can give us experiences that have a lasting impact on the way we view life and the universe.

Of particular interest are two phenomena. First, psychedelic experiences can be used with great therapeutic benefit to help those with psychological trauma, addiction, or depression. Secondly, psychedelic experiences seem to be an intriguing portal to states of ego death and unified consciousness — the feeling of being one with everything — very similar to those that meditation also aims to cultivate.

For me, this book strongly convinced me that if it were normal for the average person to have one or two psychedelic experiences in their life, the world would be a much more compassionate, loving, and peaceful place. Our societies would be filled with more open-mindedness, collaboration, and empathy, rather than ego-centric competition and "me versus other" mindsets.

I also think that simply by reading this book, which exposes one to the ways in which these experiences transform people's patterns of thinking, one can then start to cultivate these changes actively — without the need to take a psychedelic substance oneself. Certainly the magnitude will be lesser this way, but I have personally felt substantial change in my mindset since reading this book. This came simply from reading the book and attempting to consciously reproduce the states of mind described therein.

In this analogy, although "the blonde who delivered the news" appears to be "in the TV" in some sense, the TV is really just a receiver. The underlying original source of this information — the living human being — exists in an entirely different time, place, and form.

> Then I remembered what they told me, that whenever you encounter anything scary, go toward it. So instead of being afraid of dying, I got curious about what was going on. I was no longer trying to avoid dying. Instead of recoiling from the experience, I began to interrogate it. And with that, the whole situation dissolved into this pleasant floaty feeling, and I became the music for a while.

The space in which I seem to find myself, already enormous, suddenly yawns open even further.

In a sense, these experiences seem very much like a dream, but with the intensity and vividness massively amplified. Or like Neo in the Matrix (which was almost certainly inspired by the experience of dreaming).

If you believe it to be so, thus, it is so.

There are times in the evolution of a species when the old patterns no longer avail, and the radical, potentially innovative perceptions and behaviors that psychedelics sometimes inspire may offer the best chance for adaption.

I have been applying this to life in general (no psychedelics involved) and have found this strategy surprisingly effective.

This was from a study in the 1960s. The science of psychedelic therapy has actually been around for a long time, but the ban on LSD combined with the negative propaganda buried the the powerful discoveries of this research.

Yet the "personal" had been obliterated.

I think you'll find that even without psychedelic influence, the question "Where do I end and my surroundings begin?" is unanswerable if you force yourself to be absolutely precise.

This points to an interesting power of the brain that I've come across elsewhere as well: the tremendous ability of the brain to fill in gaps or modify "truth" to create a coherent story, all without you realizing there has been any fabrication at all.

This can show up in interesting ways in those with amnesia, where the brain automatically fills in blanks in the past with preposterously incorrect information. It also occurs in split-brain patients where one half of the brain will make up a completely false story to justify why the other half of the brain made a certain decision — and it will assert this blatantly fabricated story with absolute conviction.

The book includes the following image, which shows the activity of neural connections in the brain while subjects are under the influence of psilocybin versus a placebo:

> Learning entails the establishment of new neural circuits; these get stronger the more exercise they get. The long-term fate of the novel connections formed during the psychedelic experience — whether they prove durable or evanescent — might depend on whether we recall and exercise them after the experience ends.
>
> [320]

I take this to mean: If you experience some new way of thinking or perceiving during a psychedelic experience, try to repeatedly recreate that particular mental state afterwards. This will help exercise the new connections and thereby cement the changes into you brain.

A story needs time, and the ego is the story the mind tells itself about who it is.

Interestingly, *the ego* and *time* are the two fundamental causes of suffering that Eckhart Tolle repeatedly returns to in his talks and books — eliminate either of these (which will cause the other to vanish as well) and suffering cannot exist.

Perhaps what this really means is that the default mode network is the source of suffering — if we can train ourselves to turn down the default mode network, suffering will dissolve.

In my experience so far at least, this has been an effective approach.
